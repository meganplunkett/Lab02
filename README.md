# Megan Plunkett Lab 02

## Introduction

Lab 02 combines the platforms of GitHub, TextEdit, Numbers, and QGIS to visualize geo-tagged tweets from specified locations. For this assignment, I chose to compare tweets from two U.S. regions that differ culturally and politically- the Northwest region and the South. 

### Why these regions?
Especially given that today is Earth Day, I was curious to see if there would be more tweets about the holiday in a left-leaning area. I was also curious to see if there would be generally any stereotypical words tweeted in these regions- examples being "guns" or "rights" for the South and "science" or "mountains" for the Northwest.

### What did we do?
Using a Twitter API and web crawler, I was able to create a .csv file of tweets from each location. This .csv was used for maps (on QGIS) and word clouds (on Wordart.com).



## Map Description

### Map 1: Welcome to the Northwest

The map of the Northwest contains blue points- each of which representing a tweet from this area. Here, we can see that the points mostly cover Washington, but trickle into both Oregon and Idaho. 


### Map 2: Welcome to the South

The map of the Northwest contains blue points- each of which representing a tweet from this area. Here, we can see that the points mostly cover Mississippi, but trickle into Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Louisiana.


## Word Cloud Description

### World Cloud 1: Northwest Region

Unsurprisingly, the word cloud for the Northwest Region is filled with words like "medical", "care", and nearby geographic locations like "Portland". I found it interesting that "hiring" came up as a popular word, and I feel that this creates a lot of context surrounding the people living in these areas.


### World Cloud 2: South Region

There were a few surprises when looking at word clouds for the South region. As I was filtering and removing less popular words on wordart.com, there were tweets using words like "nonbinary"- an identity that is  often politicized and supported by generally left-leaning groups. However, with this, there were some predictable words, such as "work", "job", and "right".
